# Changelog - RoundRobin Plugin

## [Unreleased] - dev/glpi-11
 
### Fixed
- **Critical:** `init()` no longer calls `TRUNCATE` on existing tables during
  plugin install/upgrade. Previous behavior wiped all `is_active` settings
  every time the plugin was reinstalled or updated. Replaced with idempotent
  `syncCategories()` that inserts missing categories and removes orphaned rows
  while leaving existing configuration intact.
- **Bug:** Removed empty `item_add` hook registration for `Ticket`. The hook
  callback was a no-op after the GLPI 11 migration (assignment moved to
  `pre_item_add` via `_actors`), but the registration could cause confusion
  and double-processing in edge cases.
- **Performance:** `getAll()` now uses a single LEFT JOIN query + one bulk
  `COUNT` query instead of N+1 sequential requests (one per category + one
  per group + one per member count). Significant improvement for
  installations with many ITIL categories.
- **Bug:** Normalized line endings in `TicketHookHandler.class.php` from
  Windows CRLF to LF, consistent with the rest of the project.
 
### Added
- Spanish (Spain) locale `es_ES` — full translation of all UI strings.
- Updated `roundrobin.pot` template with previously missing strings:
  `No group assigned`, `Config saved`, `Config reset`.

### ✨ Major Changes

#### GLPI 11 Compatibility
- ✅ Updated hook system to use GLPI 11 object-based parameters (not arrays)
- ✅ Changed `pre_item_add` hook to receive `$item` object instead of `$input` array
- ✅ Updated all database operations to use `doQueryOrDie()` instead of deprecated `query()`
- ✅ Migrated logging from `error_log()` to `Toolbox::logInFile()`
- ✅ Updated CSRF token handling for GLPI 11 compatibility
- ✅ Fixed output escaping using proper `htmlspecialchars()` methods
- ✅ Added permission checks using `Session::checkRight()`

#### Round-Robin Logic Improvements
- 🔄 **Changed rotation tracking from per-category to per-group**
  - Previous: Each category had its own rotation counter (unfair distribution)
  - Now: All categories sharing the same group use one shared counter (fair distribution)
- ✅ Added active user filtering (skips inactive/deleted users automatically)
- ✅ Improved NULL index handling for first assignments
- ✅ Added consistent user ordering for predictable rotation

#### Security Enhancements
- 🔐 Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities in table operations
- 🔐 Fixed XSS vulnerabilities with proper output escaping
- 🔐 Added CSRF protection on all forms
- 🔐 Added input validation on all POST data
- 🔐 Added permission checks on configuration page

#### Performance Optimizations
- ⚡ Optimized database queries (removed N+1 query problems)
- ⚡ Added database indexes for faster lookups
- ⚡ Improved query structure with proper LIMIT clauses

#### Database Changes
- 📊 Updated table creation to use standard GLPI 11 methods
- 📊 Added proper charset and collation (utf8mb4_unicode_ci)
- 📊 Improved index structure for better performance

#### Bug Fixes
- 🐛 Fixed form submission redirects
- 🐛 Fixed configuration page save functionality
- 🐛 Fixed ticket assignment actor format for GLPI 11
- 🐛 Fixed empty group handling
- 🐛 Fixed category synchronization on install

### 📝 Technical Details

#### Files Modified
- `setup.php` - Complete rewrite for GLPI 11
- `hook.php` - Rebuilt hook handlers with new logic
